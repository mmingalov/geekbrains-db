The database stores geological information about the ore gold deposit.
The table structure is presented as follows. The indentation shows the hierarchy of parent-child relationships (everywhere 1 to many).

	PROJECT
		SITE
			SITE_SURVEY
			LITHOLOGY
			SAMPLE*
			
		DESPATCH
			DESPATCH_DETAIL
			DESPATCH_SAMPLE*
			
			RECEIPT
				RESULT
			
	LKP_CATEGORY
		LKP_CODE
		

LKP_CATEGORY and LKP_CODE store reference codes for individual data categories (well type, rock type, etc.)
These codes are used in database tables.

PROJECT - project/area
SITE - wells (drillholes)
SITE_SURVEY - collar (coordinates of drillholes)
LITHOLOGY - geological description of drillhole interval
SAMPLE - core samples collected during drillnig
DESPATCH - fact of despatch of samples to the laboratory
DESPATCH_DETAIL - despatch's details
DESPATCH_SAMPLE - samples from despatch
RECEIPT - fact of assay lab file receipt
RESULT - assay data
